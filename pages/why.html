                    <div class="notShow whyBox">
                        <p>There are several reasons why some people are hesitant to get vaccinated. Some believe that the vaccine doesn't work or that they are already protected from a previous COVID-19 infection. Others are willing to take the chance of contracting the virus due to the perceived low risk. Additionally, concerns about the speed of vaccine development, unknown ingredients, religious beliefs, and the fear of vaccines causing autism contribute to vaccine hesitancy.</p>

                    <div class="notShow whyBox">
                        <p>Not getting vaccinated can lead to various negative consequences. People who are not vaccinated are at a higher risk of contracting a more severe form of COVID-19. As the virus continues to spread, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to get infected, contributing to the emergence of new variants. To protect ourselves and our communities, it is crucial to achieve widespread vaccination and continue practicing preventive measures such as wearing masks, washing hands, and physical distancing.</p>

                        <p>Getting vaccinated is essential for protecting ourselves and others from severe illness, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19. The available vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing serious complications. By getting vaccinated, we can contribute to building herd immunity and ultimately help put an end to the pandemic. Pregnant and lactating people are also recommended to get vaccinated, and in some cases, individuals may be advised to receive a specific vaccine or delay vaccination due to medical reasons.</p>

                        <p>In February 2021, Tanzania's health minister announced that the country had no plans to accept COVID-19 vaccines, citing concerns over their safety. The country stopped releasing official COVID-19 statistics in April 2020 and declared itself free from the virus in June. The true extent of cases and deaths in Tanzania remains unknown.</p>

                    <div class="notShow whyBox">
                        <p>While the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved four COVID-19 vaccines, some countries have decided not to accept all vaccines. Member States of the European Union are obligated to issue and accept vaccine passports only for those who have received an EMA-approved vaccine. However, each country can decide whether to accept vaccines not approved by the EMA. For example, Iceland, the first European country to reopen its borders for vaccinated travelers, only accepts vaccines authorized by the EMA or World Health Organization.</p>

                        <p>The vaccine creation process involves several stages, including pre-clinical studies, testing in living organisms, and three phases of human trials. Each phase requires a larger number of participants and evaluates the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Vaccines also contain additional components such as preservatives to ensure safety and prevent bacterial contamination. The COVID-19 vaccine is essential to control the spread of the virus and protect global public health.</p>
