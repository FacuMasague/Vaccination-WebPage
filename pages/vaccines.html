            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Since Dec. 11, 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has been available under EUA in individuals 16 years of age and older, and the authorization was expanded to include those 12 through 15 years of age on May 10, 2021.</p>

            <div class="availableVaccines">
                <div>
                    <h3>Pfizer</h3>
                    <p>Use mRNA (a type of single-stranded RNA involved in protein synthesis) created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>AstraZeneca</h3>
                    <p>After the AstraZeneca vaccine is injected into our arm, the vaccine adenovirus, holding the genetic code for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, attaches to and enters our own body's cells. Once inside our cell, it travels to the nucleus to deliver the genetic code.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Sinopharm</h3>
                    <p>Works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that stud its surface.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Moderna</h3>
                    <p>Use mRNA (a type of single-stranded RNA involved in protein synthesis) created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Sinovac</h3>
                    <p>Works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that stud its surface.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Sputnik V</h3>
                    <p>Based on a proven well-studied human adenovirus vector platform; these vectors cause the common cold and have plagued humanity for millennia. Sputnik V was the first coronavirus vaccine to use a heterogeneous boosting approach based on 2 different vectors for 2 vaccine shots.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Johnson & Johnson</h3>
                    <p>The company has modified this virus to include DNA that codes for the spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This spike protein is one of the virus’ identifying features for immune cells, and what the virus uses to weasel its way into our cells.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Covaxin (BBV152)</h3>
                    <p>After receiving the vaccine, the human host translates that genetic material into the spike protein and raises an immune response to the protein, and the genetic material and spike protein both degrade, leaving behind a powerful immune arsenal of T cells, B cells, and antibodies.</p>
